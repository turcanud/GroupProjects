When you run the project, a predefined administrator account will be available in the database. To log in as an administrator, simply enter "admin:admin123" on the login page. This will grant you administrator privileges. However, if you wish to login as a customer, you need to complete the registration process first.

When logging in as an admin, you gain the ability to add, edit, and remove gyms and products. This grants you full control over managing the gyms and products within the system.
